// 
for an edge to give you anything,
living in no waste

path to arrive enduring time 
when fade performs event;

people w/ careers leaving w/ knowledge

at once we knew the multiple 
and none of us will tell we happened 
when we count how vast persists 

// 
when we say we grew the dirt, 
or only act at left or lacking 
to try and get hold the temporal 
couldn’t let the scene come with it; 
running the yards we bleed

// 
it takes the both to rest at ready, 
or still to stir at keeping warm, 
never letting till oh got there; 

in a mirror not yet aching, 
undressing out its laugh at nowhere 
what is held is also torn 

// 
we live beyond hope 

to full-cling leveled 
at its smoke 

we live beyond hope 

to lurch at further, 
or to love that curve
